TODO
===============================================================================
* Move to AJAX instead of full page load for the user front end (admin can stay as is for now)
* Responsive/Mobile site design
* Using HTML5 and possibly Javascript MP3 playback instead of relying on Flash
* User login with each user having ability to manage multiple profiles
* Update CakePHP & fix any breakages that causes / Possibly remove the need for CakePHP all together to make it lighter
